<h1>Tic_Tac_Toe</h1>

Tic Tac Toe is one of my favorite games, why I wanted to build it in one of the more popular languages. </P>

<h2>How to play</h2>

*  The first thing to do is read the instructions and then write "yes" in front of the question "Do you want to play?"

*  Ask your opponent to play first. The first player will use "X" and the second will use "O". Each one must try to form a line with its respective symbol on the squares on the board.

*  Make your move (or ask your opponent to play). After the first step, the opponent enters the next position which must be different from your opponent's position. If you enter the same position, you pass the turn to your opponent. He can try to prevent the opponent from closing a line on the board or focus on his own strategy. The ideal is to do both at the same time.

*  Alternate moves with your opponent until one of you wins (or draws). The first person to position  "X" or "O" in a row – horizontally, vertically or diagonally – wins. However, if both players are skilled, the chances of a tie are much higher.

*  Keep training. Contrary to what many think, tic-tac-toe is not just about luck. There are several strategies that optimize player skills. Keep training to learn how to use some of them and win (almost) every match.
